## Engagement Guidelines

1. **General Transactions:** For standard transactions, such as grant pass-throughs, we apply a 5% operational fee. This supports our ongoing company operations.
2. **VAT Adjustments:** Any VAT paid or refunded will be reconciled at the close of the financial year.
3. **Grant Approvals:** Should a grant not be approved and no funds are transacted through the account, no fees will be levied.
4. **Open Dialogue:** We value open communication. If you have any questions or wish to discuss specific terms, please reach out to Wawa.
